# Diabetes_Prediction_System

This project aims to develop an AI-based Diabetes Prediction System using publicly available Kaggle datasets and IBM technologies. Leveraging machine learning algorithms and IBM's robust cloud-based infrastructure, we will preprocess and analyze medical data to build an accurate predictive model for diabetes risk. By harnessing the power of AI and IBM's tools, this system intends to provide valuable insights for early diabetes detection and potentially contribute to improved healthcare outcomes.
